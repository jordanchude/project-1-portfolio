# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Project Description

For my final website, as a top to bottom description, I am going to have a navigation bar with several links at the top of the page, with links pushed to the left of the navigation and myy name at the right of the description. At a certain width, the navigation bar will turn into a hamburger, with no links visible until the user hits the button.

Under the navigation bar, I am going to have a hero section with a larger, horizontal-dimensioned photo of myself with the text "Jordan Williams" centered and "Podcast Host, Artist Management Consultant, Developer" under it. If I have time, I am going to use Javascript to fade those into the hero once the page has loaded.

Under it, I plan on having three equally sized sections, size by side, that explain my skill set. One for web development, one for consulting, and one for designing. In each section, I'll have a list of what each of those skill sets can offer the viewer.

Under that section, I want to use a grid-like format for web development projects with a screenshot of each project and a button under the screenshot to view on github pages. I also want to have the same format extend to a few Instagram videos from my podcast. 

Finally, I am going to have a google contact form and a footer at the bottom of the page with my social media links.

## Google Sheet

Include link to your google sheet here.  Here is the sample [Suresh had used in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1M3Eq1NXH2PNmeTlVviRhEjX9kenq769Vo2P5mMtro/edit#gid=0)

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Anything else that is not MVP

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
